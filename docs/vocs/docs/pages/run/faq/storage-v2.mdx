# Storage V2 (Experimental)

:::warning
`--storage.v2` is **experimental**. It is stable enough for testing and non-critical workloads,
but may change in future releases. Please report issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/issues)
or in the [Telegram group](https://t.me/paradigm_reth).
:::

Reth v1.11 introduces an experimental hot/cold storage architecture behind the `--storage.v2` flag.
It routes history indices and transaction hash lookups to RocksDB, writes changesets to static files,
and drops the legacy plain state tables — resulting in significantly lower disk usage.

## Disk savings

Measured at block `24,396,823` on Ethereum mainnet:

| Node Type | Without `--storage.v2` | With `--storage.v2` | Savings |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| Full      | 1.46 TB                | 1.02 TB             | **-30%** |
| Minimal   | 449 GB                 | 224 GB              | **-50%** |
| Archive   | 2.99 TB                | 2.31 TB             | **-23%** |

## Quick start

### Fresh sync

`--storage.v2` is a **genesis-initialization-only** setting. You must start a fresh sync — it cannot be enabled on an existing database.

```bash
reth node \
    --storage.v2 \
    --authrpc.jwtsecret /path/to/secret
```

Combine with other flags as usual (`--full`, `--minimal`, `--http`, etc.):

```bash
reth node \
    --storage.v2 \
    --full \
    --http --http.api eth,trace \
    --authrpc.jwtsecret /path/to/secret
```

### Using snapshots

To avoid syncing from genesis, download a pre-built snapshot from
[snapshots.reth.rs](https://snapshots.reth.rs) and start from there:

```bash
# Download and extract a v2 snapshot (see snapshots.reth.rs for available options)
reth download --chain mainnet

# Then start the node
reth node \
    --authrpc.jwtsecret /path/to/secret
```

## Important caveats

- **Fresh sync required** — you cannot enable `--storage.v2` on an existing v1 database. If you have an existing node, you need to either resync from scratch or restore from a v2 snapshot.
- **Cannot switch back** — once a database is initialized with `--storage.v2`, it stays that way. Switching back to v1 storage requires a full resync without the flag.
- **Experimental** — the storage format may change between releases. Future upgrades could require a resync.
